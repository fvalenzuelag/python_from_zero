## Introduction

Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Whether you are new to programming or looking to expand your skills, this repository will guide you through the basics of Python.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fvalenzuelag/python_from_zero.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory:
```bash
cd python_from_zero
```

## Basic Concepts

### Variables and Data Types

Learn how to declare variables and understand different data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Example:
```python
x = 10  # integer
y = 3.14  # float
name = "Python"  # string
is_active = True  # boolean
```

### Control Structures

Understand how to use control structures like `if` statements, loops (`for` and `while`), and how they control the flow of your program. Example:
```python
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

### Functions

Learn how to define and call functions to organize and reuse your code. Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

### Modules and Packages

Explore how to use modules and packages to structure your code and leverage external libraries. Example:
```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))
```

## Exercises

This section includes various exercises to practice what youâ€™ve learned. Each exercise comes with a description and sample code to get you started.
